{"name":"Lava","tagline":"Let the collections flow","body":"# Lava [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metaldrummer610/Lava.png)](https://travis-ci.org/metaldrummer610/Lava)\r\n\r\n## What is Lava?\r\n**Lava** is a Java library that is built to do one thing, make collections easier to work with. Lava is a more or less port of Microsoft's [LINQ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb397926.aspx) library.\r\n\r\n## Why would I want to use Lava?\r\nHave you ever needed to search through an `ArrayList` of People to find everyone who's name begins with the letter 'R'? Lava has a convience method for that. Ever need to transform a `Collection` from one type to another? Lava has a method for that as well. Lava has a plethora of methods that allow you to modify collections to your hearts content.\r\n\r\nIf that wasn't enough to wet your appetite, feast your eyes on this little code sample:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Assumptions: 'people' is a java.util.Collection of Person objects and the Person object has a 'String name' member.\r\nEnumerable<String> names = Lava.select(people, new Func<Person, String>() {\r\n    public String callback(Person person) {\r\n        return person.name;\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the bit of code above doing? Well, it is transforming the collection of people into a Lava Enumerable that contains all of the people's names. Simple huh?\r\n\r\nHow about this:\r\n```java\r\n// Assumptions: 'people' is a collection of Person objects and the Person object has an 'int age' member.\r\nEnumerable<Person> lessPeople = Lava.where(people, new Func<Person, Boolean>() {\r\n    public Boolean callback(Person person) {\r\n        return person.age > 10;\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bit of code is filtering the people collection down to only the people whose ages are above 10. This would be a good time to point out that all of the lava methods that return `Enumerable` types are returning copies of the original objects, and are not modifying the source collection.\r\n\r\nBy now, you're probably thinking \"Ok this is cool and all, but I want to filter and transform my collection in a single line, not call all of these methods one by one\". Good news! You can chain the method calls all you want. As long as the Lava method returns an Enumerable instance, you can continue chaining your calls all day long.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```java\r\nEnumerable<String> names = Lava.where(people, new Func<Person, Boolean>() {\r\n    public Boolean callback(Person person) {\r\n        return person.age > 10;\r\n    }\r\n}).select(people, new Func<Person, String>() {\r\n    public String callback(Person person) {\r\n        return person.name;\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis little snippet chains the `where` method with the `select` method in order to create a new Enumerable containing only the people's names who are also over the age of 10! How cool is that?\r\n\r\n### More examples\r\nIf you would like to see more examples, check out the unit tests. Each Lava function has a unit test that shows how to use it.\r\n\r\n## So how do I get started?\r\nWell, first you need to clone the master branch of Lava and build the project (sorry, no Maven artifact yet...). Once it's built and placed in your classpath, you'll want to turn your attention to the `Lava` class. This class exposes all of the methods of the library statically, so there's no need for any setup. \r\n\r\n(Almost) all of the `Lava` methods return an object of type `Enumerable`, which allow you to chain method calls. For example, you could filter a list using `where`, transform the result using `select`, then sort the results using `orderBy` all in a single method chain.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the classes and methods available in **Lava**, take a look at the [JavaDocs](http://metaldrummer610.github.com/Lava/javadoc/). More documentation can be found at the project's [homepage](http://metaldrummer610.github.com/Lava)\r\n\r\n## Building the project\r\nThe project uses [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) for it's build process. All one must do is a simple `gradle jar` command in the root directory and Gradle will take care of the rest.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nSo far, the only dependency for the project is the [Guava](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) library. I am also including [jUnit](http://junit.sourceforge.net/) for testing, but that is not needed in a production release.\r\n\r\n## Contributing to the project\r\nTo contribute to the project, please follow the [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) workflow. I have checked the develop branch into github so that any cutting-edge development can take place there, while leaving the master for tagged releases. Please try to adhere to these guidelines.\r\n\r\nSteps to add a method to the project:\r\n\r\n1. run `git flow feature start {name of method}`\r\n2. Add the desired method to LavaBase.java\r\n3. Add the static version of the method to Lava.java\r\n4. Add the instance version of the method to Enumerable.java (but make sure to remove the 'source' collection from the parameters, as the source will become the current Enumerable's `collection` member)\r\n5. Add a unit test for the new function (make sure it works!)\r\n6. Make sure it's all committed and run `git flow feature finish`\r\n7. Push your changes to the develop branch\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
